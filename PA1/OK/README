ANSWERS TO ASSIGNMENT README QUESTIONS (if applicable):

1. The probability is: 25% for two-head,  25% for two-tail, and 50% for head-tail.
   Reason:
   For two coins A and B, the result of a toss only have four outcomes: 
   A-head / B-head
   A-head / B-tail
   A-tail / B-head
   A-tail / B-tail
   So we can see, there are 2 outcomes for the head-tail, and 1 outcome for both two-head  
   and two-tails out of the total 4 outcomes.
   Then we can say the probability is 25% for two-head,  25% for two-tail, and 50% for
   head-tail.

2. 4500
3. The largest value I tried where it still worked correctly is 2147483647
   And the one where it overflowed is 2147483648
